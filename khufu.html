      <h1 style="font-family: Algerian; font-weight: lighter;">Khufu's Funeral Boat</h1>
    <img src="Images/Screenshot 2024-12-27 123651.png">
    <p>Although we think of Egyptian boat burials as long majestic wooden boats, reed boats were associated 
        with religion and funerary purposes even in the Old Kingdom. They believed that you would sail along 
        the Nile into the afterlife on the boats. Although most evidence consists of hardened prints in 
        mud and sand superstructures, (a fully structured boat has yet to be found), archeologists can 
        tell that most were about 50 feet long. Their construction bears remarkable resemblance to sailing
        and active vessels. Although now restored, Khufu's burial boat was found in almost perfect 
        condition, just taken apart and found stacked neatly in piles. Workers faced a "3D "jigsaw puzzle" 
        when putting it back together. 20 feet wide and 150 feet long, archaeologists were surprised 
        when they found that the ship was not built in modern fashion. Instead, they discovered that 
        wooden planks of cedar were sewn together with rope running through all of them. Twelve oars
        were used to propel the boat, and two massive oars were steering at the front. It is currently
        displayed in the Grand Egyptian Museum near Cairo.
